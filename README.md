**Carmen_db_Dbt** is an open-source data transformation project created using dbt (data build tool) to transform and model data for the fictional Carmen database. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to use dbt to create a data pipeline that transforms raw data into usable and reliable data for business analytics and reporting.

<h2>Requirements</h2>
To run this project, you will need:<br/>
1. dbt installed on your machine<br/>
2. Carmen dataset downloaded<br/>
<h2>Installation</h2><br/>
1. Clone this repository to your local machine<br/>
2.In your terminal, navigate to the root directory of the project<br/>
3.Set the dbt profile for yout project<br/>
4. Run dbt seed to load the seed data into the database<br/>
5.Run dbt run to execute the transformations<br/>
<h2>Usage</h2><br/>
Once the project is installed, you can use the following dbt commands to work with the data:<br/>
1.**dbt seed** - loads the seed data into the database<br/>
2.**dbt run** - executes the transformations<br/>
3.**dbt test** - runs the tests to ensure data quality<br/>
<h2>Credits</h2><br/>
This project was created by Akomal as part of a dbt learning project. Special thanks to the dbt community for their support and contributions to the project.
